### Besterday
 
The best thing you did yesterday.

Besterday helps you record a short, happy memory (a "bestie") for each day of your life. This enables you to dwell on the positive, and as time goes on you can also use this to reflect back on great moments in the past.

The app consists of two main views:
* Profile: Overview of your "bestie" stats, including your longest consecutive streak and a count of all the besties you've ever recorded
* Bestie Permalink: Let's you view and edit a full-sized bestie, enabling you both to post your latest memory or to edit past moments.

There are also a few ways to browse your besties:
* Swipe-to-browse: Once you dive into a bestie, you can swipe left/right to browse older or newer besties
* Profile feed: You can browse all of your besties in one place at the bottom of your profile. These feature smaller besties sorted chronologically.
